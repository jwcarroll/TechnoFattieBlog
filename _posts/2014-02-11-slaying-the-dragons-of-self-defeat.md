**TL;DR** - *Sometimes, climbing a mountain has more to do with the challenge inside of you, than the one in front of you.*

### A Long Journey

I finally got my new blog up and running. It took me a long time to get this done
but it has been a great learning experience. I plan to write plenty about the technical side of migrating this blog
from [Blogger][1] to using [Jekyll][2] with [GitHub pages][3].

But first... I wanted to tell you a story about getting here.

When I sat down to write this blog post, it was going to be all about how awesome Jekyll and GitHub Pages were. However,
something interesting happened while writing. I discovered that spending the past several weeks of nights and weekends
migrating my blog over had little to do with blogging, and everything to do with overcoming personal obstacles.

### Techno Fattie? Seriously?

I started by blog on a whim 7 years ago because [Leon Bambrick of SecretGeek](http://secretgeek.net/), one of the first
blogs I ever read, had posted a challenge for [creating a mandelbrot using F#](http://secretgeek.net/f_mandel.asp), and
I wanted to respond, [so I did]({% post_url 2007-12-22-mandelbrot-bitmap %}). To my great surprise, Leon linked back to
my blog the next day, and thus, **Techno Fattie** was set in stone.

Eventually I actually became more interested in blogging because I love to write, but...

### Blogger Sucks!

But that isn't really the truth is it? I mean, there is a lot to complain about when it comes to
blogger, but as a platform someone can be up and blogging in seconds. And... there are plenty of
people out there who have amazing looking blogs that are powered by blogger.

Alas, mine was not one of them.

My blog looked exactly like the amount of effort I had put into it, *which was zero.*
**I wanted a great looking blog, but I did absolutely nothing to actually *build* a great blog.**
As a web developer, I have built dozens and dozens of sites, so deep down I knew how much effort really
goes into creating and maintaining a decent web site, but for some reason I kept convincing myself that it
shouldn't be the same for *my site.*

Blogger turned out just to be a convenient excuse to be lazy instead of do what I really wanted to do... **build
the thing myself.**

### Inventing Roadblocks

The mind is a very powerful thing. **It can be our greatest adversary or our greatest foe.** It's also quite deceptive,
and nobody is better at fooling us, than us.

I have been meaning to blog more pretty much every day for the past 7 years. The conversation in my head would go
something like this:

> I need to start blogging more. But first... I really need to improve
> my blog, I mean look at it. Who cares what I write if people want to
> vomit when they see it.
>
> Ok, let me see about customizing Blogger. Blah blah... custom templates
> ... blah blah... dude this looks terrible! Hey, I'm a developer I'll just
> write my own blog! If [Rob Connery](http://www.wekeroad.com/) can do it then
> so can I!

So that's what I did. My original intent was just to sit down and type out a few thoughts, but I invented reasons
for not doing it disguised as "work." The reality is that **I was just inventing roadblocks for myself in order to
avoid doing the real work.** I was chasing ridiculous pipe dreams instead of creating something valuable.

### Getting Busy

I'm not sure what happened, or when, but I got sick and tired of just **wanting** to build my blog, and finally
just got off my rear end and decided to do it. I also wasn't going to spend the next six months of my life writing
a crappy custom blogging engine when there were already so many good ones out there. And besides, **my goal was to
start writing more... not coding more.**

I had heard about [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), and it looked promising. I was almost convinced
when I saw [Elijah Manor blog about converting over to ghost](http://www.elijahmanor.com/from-blogger-to-ghost/). Still,
I really wanted to have a lot of control over the site as a developer.

**And then I found out about [Jekyll][2].**

The more I dug into it, the more it was love at first site. I knew Octopress was basically built on top of Jekyll, but
I really wanted to learn this from the ground up before getting too fancy. So I dug in and started learning the ropes.

As a web developer, Jekyll gives me the control I want over my content, while [automating enough things][4] to make it an
easy experience as well.

I use Bootstrap every day at work, so I was able to easily adapt a professionally done
[Bootstrap][5] theme ["von minimalist blog"][7] that I paid $12 for over at [Wrap Bootstrap][5]. I am not a very good designer
so that choice was a no-brainer for me. I also borrowed some heavy inspiration from various sites using Jekyll,
most notably was [Matias Niemel√§'s](https://twitter.com/yearofmoo) site: [year of moo][8].

At the end of the day, I felt like a web developer working on *my* site, not just using somebody else's framework.
Most importantly, there is no real infrastructure to have to maintain, or troubleshoot. There is no database; no admin
page; no server application to setup and run; so **I can just focus on what I really
care about... the content.**

### Slaying The Dragons

When I finally got this thing published, I was pretty ecstatic. I know it may seem silly, but that is because you only
see a simple little static web site. **For me it was years of languish and self defeat that prevented me from moving
forward with something I have always wanted to do.**

Oh there are still a **million** things I *want* to do to this site, and a **million** ways I *want* to improve it, but
I had to set an attainable goal and stop chasing mountain tops of my own creation.

Now it's time to get busy slaying the next dragon, and the next, and the next...

**If you have any of your own dragons you have slain recently I would love to hear about it in the comments.**
