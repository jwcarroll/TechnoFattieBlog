title: Whine Less... Code More
---

<div class="tr_bq"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Developers are a whiny bunch.</span></b></div><br />Today I was reading one of <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OneASPNETSneakPeekElegantWebFormsAndSnowballsInHell.aspx">Scott Hanselman's latest posts</a> on some improvements being made in WebForms, and was pretty amazed at how generally whiny the comments were.<br /><br />You could read all the comments, but they can pretty much be broken down into 3 categories of whiny trolls.<br /><br /><b>The Hater</b><br /><br /><div style="background-color: #fff2cc;">Dear Scott,<br /><br />You suck! WebForms sucks! Microsoft sucks! And pretty much every technology they produce is total garbage. I still program using the MS stack of course... cause you know... I'd rather complain than learn a new technology.</div><br /><b>The Righteous One</b><br /><br /><div style="background-color: #fff2cc;">Dear Scott,<br /><br />How can you even look at yourself in the mirror after writing such filthy code. I realize this is just a blog post... meant to be a simple&nbsp;demonstration&nbsp;of a new feature, but how dare you not follow all 5 of the SOLID principles, complete with a full suite of unit and integration tests (written first of course). You didn't even use an IoC!!!!&nbsp;And you call yourself a programmer!&nbsp; <br /><br />All .Net developers are pretty much worthless, incompetent boobs... except for me of course. I would write a better example myself, but I'm too busy telling people like you how crappy a programmer they are :P</div><br /><b>The Hipster</b><br /><br /><div style="background-color: #fff2cc;">Dear Scott,<br /><br />Whoa dude! WebForms is so primitive man. Only old people and corporate shills program in WebForms. Everybody knows that MVC is what all the cool kids are using. That internal corporate app I wrote is like... blowing minds... all five of them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Besides, everybody knows that WebForms is way too much abstraction, and the ViewState, oh man was it terrible. I never knew what the ViewState was for, but I know it was bad! With MVC I can get down to bare metal baby! I still don't know what a Handler or Module is, and I never really touch the form collection or HttpContext... but it's so much less abstract than WebForms.</div><br />So, to all you whiny programmers out there, I have a some people you should meet.&nbsp;I know you know these people. You probably troll their blogs regularly.<br /><br /><hr /><div style="padding: 10px;"><a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html">Bob Martin</a>, <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/feathers_m.html">Michael Feathers</a>, <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/jeffries_r.html">Ron Jeffries</a> and <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> were doing awesome things while you were still drinking from a sippy cup.<br /><br /><a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>&nbsp;liked Ruby and needed a web framework. <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">So he wrote one</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> didn't like big heavy ORM's so <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">he wrote a tiny one</a>.
