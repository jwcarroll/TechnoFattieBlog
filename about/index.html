   <h3>Development Experience</h3>
   <p>
   I've been hacking on computers since I was about 8 years old. It's no wonder I love the web so much since
   my first "programming" experience was teaching myself HTML and pushing a website out to some acedemic server.
   All I can remember is how fascinated I was with being able to access my own site... ON THE INTERNET!!!
   </p>
   <p>
   I went on to do some <em>real</em> programming in high school, and eventually got to compete in a robotics competition my senior year.
   Becoming a programmer was all I wanted to do, and I went after it full speed ahead. I graduated from <a href="http://www.etsu.edu/etsuhome/">ETSU</a> in 2005 and have been
   doing what I love ever since.
